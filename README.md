# Image Dataset Oversampling

This project provides a Python script for loading an image dataset, performing random oversampling on the minority class, and displaying the count of samples per class before and after oversampling.

## Features

- Load an image dataset from a specified directory.
- Perform random oversampling on a specified minority class by rotating images.
- Display the count of samples per class before and after oversampling.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- PIL (Pillow)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the script.

2. Install the required packages using pip:
